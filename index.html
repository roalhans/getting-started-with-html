<h2>Importance of a different way of learning</h2>

<b>Different Area</b>
<br>I have studies in business and economics but I always have had a tendendy to technology.</br>
<br>I think this course will help me to see things in a different way, just as I read in your introductory words.</br>

<p>I believe self learning should be a must these days and this kind of <em>platform</em> is just great. <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> is something that every kid in the world should know about it.</p>

<b>Ways of thinking</b>
<p>I found very interesting the concept that computers are stupid. I have heard that phrase before but now I get it very well. I believe this can help people to see the importance of clear and simpple instructions.</p>

<b>Programming for life</b>
<p>Knowing how to link <a href="https://www.google.com">this</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com">that</a> can help us understand the interrelation of <em>HTML Documents</em> and the the concept of internet.</p>
